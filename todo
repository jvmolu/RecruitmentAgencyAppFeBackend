1. Refactor ZodParsingError and AuthError handling in a error handler to remove 
the error response creation code from services and controllers and use the error handler instead.

2. Add 404 status code in FIND calls and UPDATE calls if no data is found based on search params.

3. Add <= and >= and LIMIT and OFFSET Search Functionality

4. Write Join Queries to return combined Data

5. From all routes, in CATCH (if there is try catch), do NEXT(error) as we have added a common error handling middleware
