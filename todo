1. Refactor ZodParsingError and AuthError handling in a error handler to remove 
the error response creation code from services and controllers and use the error handler instead.

2. Add 404 status code in FIND calls and UPDATE calls if no data is found based on search params.

3. Add <= and >= Functionality

4. LIMIT and OFFSET and ORDER_BY Search Functionality -- Done for jobs Only

5. Write Join Queries to return combined Data -- Done for jobs only

6. From all routes, in CATCH (if there is try catch), do NEXT(error) as we have added a common error handling middleware

7. Add a check - currently the value of orderBy params is directly going into sql, - ADD VALIDATIONS FOR IT

8. Add a Response Filtering Layer before sending output (Specially Needed for Job Data)

9. Add selectFields input option in all GET calls to select only required fields - V2 (This way FE controls what fields are required from table - Light Responses)
